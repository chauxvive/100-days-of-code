# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: May 12, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued work on Flashcards app. Sent/read my first username cookies, did route handling, error handling, and played with lots of middleware with Express. 

**Thoughts**: Excited to start sending cookies and reading states. Unlike my early interactions with node and JSON, I can say I really get this stuff the first time around and find myself in a state of flow where hours fly by unnoticed. I am eager to finish the Treehouse Full Stack track. So close at this point!

### Day 3: May 12, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* More CodeAcademy on JavaScript. I don't remember the old course being this buggy!
* Finished Gulp on Treehouse, started Treehouse Express flashcard app with Pug template. Really sailing through here.
* Sent out three bids to small Upwork projects. 
* Read up on CRLF/LF endings, "use strict" in JS, and marketing for new devs.

**Thoughts**: Definitely seeing better why Gulp is important today. I can't wait to start building apps and using this stuff. Also excited to get into Express, MongoDB, Angular, React, and Redux. I'm really looking forward to building this flashcard app and customizing it later on. At some point, I need to learn Sass, Canvas, and grid/flexbox/bootstrap better.

### Day 2: May 11, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Did the gulp tutorial on TeamTreehouse. Successfully installed windows build tools with powershell.
* Read about powershell vs cmd and the history of each.
* Read about React, JSX, and Redux
* Ripped out some easy JavaScript and Ruby exercises back at CodeAcademy

**Thoughts**: Gulp is simple to understand and cool for automating tasks, but I think I need more practice without it to really appreciate what its used for. Hard to believe I was completely unfamiliar with using command line and npm a few weeks ago- now it's the linchpin of most of my work. Had to bring my stepmom home from the hospital and deal with dad today- more than had my hands full. It reminds me why I'm doing this: with dad's cancer, I need to be free when I have to be but still make money. That's why I'm studying as hard and as fast as I can.  
However, I need to keep my eye on the prize- being a in-depth full stack dev is less important than bringing in money which may mean monetizing simpler front-end things. It means taking the good over the perfect- which means reviewing and practicing WordPress and front end so I can do that quickly and easily (because those gigs are more accessible to new developers.) Tweaking WordPress themes quickly and easily will probably make more money now than having a medium familiarity with creating APIs from scratch.

### Day 1: May 10, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Updated theater portfolio website with L'Egisto section 
* Did Codewars 7kyu kata
* Improved CS50 Mario to "more" version
* Wrote and debugged CS50 Cash, started Credit 
* Reviewed Markdown conventions and shortcuts
* Read up on floating point arithmetic and rounding errors. Gross.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get back to JavaScript after fooling with Ruby, C#, and C the past few days. Really glad I understand Markdown now. Between that and getting used to Git and terminal, I'm starting to feel more like a "real" developer. Every time I force myself to go to code meetups, I enjoy myself and learn a lot, even if it's outside of my comfort zone. Yesterday I felt very "stuck" on the material I had been learning the past few weeks (AHH why is going from front end JS to back end so hard??) but I sat down and figured out exactly why I felt so stuck, then jotted down actionable goals of what progress would look like and how I could get there. Now I feel like I've had a minor breakthrough. It's amazing how facing your frustrations and fears head-on can help you move past them.

### Day 0: May 9, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on Harvard's CS50. Today was fighting through the first few of problem set one (Hello, Mario). Updated my wordpress theater portfolio with new features. 

**Thoughts**: Restarting #100daysofcode so I can track it here. My original attempt was at around 27 days. It's been a very chaotic season with family health and too many funerals but I'm not giving up. I've been using FreeCodeCamp, TeamTreehouse, CodeAcademy, and CodeWars. I've also started going to the New Haven I/O meetups and joined their slack which has been very helpful.   

C is so far my absolute least favorite language (of Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift etc.) Hate. Such hate. But it's like Latin, right, I'm not really supposed to like it? Or maybe more like classical greek which I enjoyed even less?

[//]: #**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

[//]: #**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
