# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 9, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working on Harvard's CS50. Today was fighting through the first few of problem set one (Hello, Mario). Updated my wordpress theater portfolio with new features. 

**Thoughts**: Restarting #100daysofcode so I can track it here. My original attempt was at around 27 days. It's been a very chaotic season with family health but I'm not giving up. I've been using FreeCodeCamp, TeamTreehouse, CodeAcademy, and CodeWars. I've also started going to the New Haven I/O meetups and joined their slack which has been very helpful. C is so far my absolute least favorite language (of Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift etc.) Hate. Such hate. But it's like Latin, right, I'm not really supposed to like it? Or maybe more like classical greek which I enjoyed even less?

[//]: #**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

[//]: #**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
