### Day 37: June 25nd, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* read up on free SSL options, requested free SSL certs for all my sites
* watched: Duolingo documentary.
* pocast- finished JS party - graphy ql. Definitely piqued my interest in it and suddenly it's everywhere.
* started my WP child theme for Lighthouse Child that's got better responsive styles.

**June 17th worth - last makeup day (4:30-5:30++)**
* continued work to figure out what isn't working with Child theme. I should really start developing WP locally, especially on a project like this. I know how, I just haven't been doing it.
* reinstall 7-zip. Hurray open source! Also Malwarebytes.
* signed up and started watching JavaScript30
* Bluehost support time (really not liking much of what I'm reading about BH)
* Extremely excited to have figured out my permissions error in creating a VMware machine on my own after endless tutorials and reading. So incredibly satisfying. 

**Thoughts**: Excited about the stuff I'm learning again, thank god. I had to take a mini break from FCC. I REALLY like seeing the stories of people building cool things and using code and technology to make a meaningful difference. FluentU has been helping me refresh my spanish. We leave a week from tomorrow and honestly I'm freaked out about getting things done before we go... plus, it may be childish, but Mexico is the most non-first-world place we've been to and we're not staying on the beaten path in a resort. I keep telling myself people like us (and even less prepared) go to Tulum all the time- but I probably won't believe it until I go and see for myself. As much as I love traveling, I often get anxious before we go!
* Having trouble getting the full parent styles to pull over into my new child theme. Lots of investigating to do on why that's not working (probably has to do with bootstrap?) but this is definitely a start. Meanwhile, last night, in doing some research for this, I realized there are a ton of mysterious ftp account requests on my Bluehost which means the injection attack I was having so much trouble with probably came from the Bluehost side NOT from wordpress. That is both encouraging and enraging, but will help me prevent further attacks. Better change my password as well.
* Update: turns out I had two spurious users. FTPs were a red herring, but I removed them anyway.
* Wow, covered an incredible amount of ground today, even with a migraine! Very pleased at how much I got done/figured out. AND I'm fully caught up with hours and then some.

### Day 36: June 24nd, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Podcast: JS party - graph ql
* Played with MAMP to get a local Apache server going. Yay!
* Reviewing wordpress videos on treehouse- wow, it's been a while. What I really need to understand is how to create a child theme so I can make my current WP page themes more responsive. Hard to find the information...  
**Thoughts**: (Still need to make up June 17th.) Had a production meeting and discovered it sounds like the gig I had set for when we get home from Tulum may be falling through, so, again, fire under butt to actually get some clients. I LOVE figuring things out. I adore teaching myself things and teaching others. Unfortunately, I do NOT love selling myself. I really need to get over it!

### Day 35: June 23nd, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Stack exchange came through again. Finished FCC use the map Method. I'm still not crystal clear but I feel better about it than I had.
* Time for something fun - User Interfaces in VR on TeamTreehouse! Uh oh, it's all in Unity which I haven't touched yet. ARkit is another thing I'm really dying to play with on a Mac.
* OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities - XSS: How it works (Treehouse)
  
**Thoughts**: Went to Plymouth with mom and Brian to see family graves. She's wanted to do that a long time. Still loving that Pomodoro timer for lighting a fire under my butt. Still racking up that WakaTime. Good stuff.

### Day 34: June 22nd, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress(4-5)**: 
* Podcasts: Syntax- SUPER helpful workflow episode. Pure gold to a new coder like myself.
* Podcasts: Indie Hackers - Free Code Camp, CodePen Radio- Trends
* still fighting with FCC use the map Method but finally getting it. Passing all but one test, sending it to StackExchange for aid.
* started FCC implement map on a prototype

 **June 16th worth (final 1/2 hour)**
* back to VMWare to work on something that doesn't make me want to throw things(I hope)

**June 17th worth - last makeup day**
  
**Thoughts**: Trapped dealing with family things most of today. I have to cut out/say no to social time when it gets in the way of code (I did not invite any of these folks but was still stuck entertaining.) I had literally ONE really great, productive day all week. That's not going to work! Had a talk with husband about it. We still have a dinner party tonight :( Just like I had to explain that when I'm working, I need to focus and can't really chat, today I had to explain that I'm really not getting the undistracted time when I need it. Working from home is its own unique set of challenges. Since it's 4 and I just got in the door, I explained I couldn't do any prep for tonight because I had to code. I'm lucky he understands. We try to have each other's back.
- I really should start doing more blogging or maybe podcasting work. I do really like talking to people.   
-Love WakaTime because it helps keep me honest. Using the pomodoro clock keeps me from tangenting away too, keeps the pressure on.

### Day 33: Thursday, June 21th

**Today's worth (10:30-11:30)**
 * listened to Syntax podcast
 * working on FCC Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions - using BDD has definitely helped with more complicated assignments like this, but I still come up to roadblocks. I got every test to pass but the last one, where the two methods are used together (spoiler alert: they do not..) Bummer.
 * working on FCC use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array. I am really having trouble understanding proper usage of .map which is so frustrating because it seems like a very simple concept, but none of my practice tests are working. Tough night.
 * Refactor Global Variables update: Stack Exchange saves the day! I had accidently reused a global variable I didn't mean to. Brilliant, done.

 **June 16th worth (11:30-12:30)**
   * see above

### Day 33: Wednesday, June 20th

**Today's worth (11-12)**
 * finished OOP section of Javascript FCC
 * started Functional Programming
 * Chrome is accepting Github links again. I'll take it.

**Thoughts:** Still trucking. At work early today, only June 16th and 17th left to catch up! I'm not giving myself "day" credit for these, to keep my counting simple, but it makes me feel more honest. Much more sympathetic to FCC and Quincy Larsen's great work. Impressed about the Microsoft Strike. I am a strong believer in the inherent need of ethical consideration in coding, so it's good to see developers taking interest in how their talents are used. I really want to code for Good in the future. Also, understanding tests and test-making processes has definitely changed my fundamental approach to these JS challenges, pushing me to more behavior-driven design (BDD). I should take a break and do more open-form projects soon- maybe dividing my days in half or doing every other day. I suspect that starting the day with solve-the-problem hand-holding will prime my mind to the second half, more open form work, which will push my applications and make sure I have work I can show and be proud of. I've always been self-driven, but becoming mostly my own boss has taught me an incredible amount about structure, discipline, and motivation. Having the whole day to do whatever you want is both a blessing and a curse. Discipline, discipline, discipline!


### Day 32: Tuesday Juneteeth
* Ok, yesterday went pretty well! I'm working this morning but not long. Got a half hour this morning to finish up a few things. Now I only have 15, 16, & 17's worth to make up (I'm giving myself those two other two-day breaks.)

**Today's worth (5-6):**
 * finder's keepers & BooHoo algorithms on FCC
 * started slice and splice
 * set up a Bitbucket just in case. 
 * read up on Hg(Mercurial)- not a good sign that all the articles are incredibly old. (I am very unconvinced)
 * listened to Quincy Larsen Indie Hackers podcast
 * Updating coding to-do list
 
 **June 15th's worth (12-1):**
 * Finished up Slice/Splice and done with basic algorithm scripting. 
 * Started OOP FCC (ripped through 12)
 * finished Indie Hackers podcast


### Day 31: Monday, June 18th
* We're going to make this work. I'm going to work an hour for each day missed here so I can keep moving. I needed a few days off for family needs and to fight burn out. I'm not giving up. For each hour I work the next week, I will mark my progress for the missing days until I'm caught up, one hour at a time. I've set a timer- first hour: GO!
* Life updates: Took Brian out on our first catamaran ride, such a pleasure to handle and ride! Definitely hooked. Took my dad on a Whale Watch out of Glouchester, something I had never done. Saw three beautiful humpback whales very close (including a mom and calf), a minke whale, and dolphin. Started some really exciting photography work, in part because I was inspired by the "product page" assignment from FCC. Got some serious complements on my work lately which is freaking great.

**Today, June 18th worth, 2:30-3:30:
* read up on travel developers
* researched running Sketch on windows
* got and installed VMware to play with. I'm determined to learn Sketch. Plus, I first played with VMs in high school and I'm very excited to do so again. DLing a copy of High Sierra. 
* got updated on slack, emails- not glamorous, but needed
* did some more FCC exercises (Basic Data Structures)
* got some more assets for my photography product page (photologo- way exciting.)

Iced chai/laundry/errand break!

**June 12th worth, 5-6
* got wakatime working and hooked into my editor. Alright!
* updated my WP blog
* github is still blocked by my chrome. Boo.
* FCC Basic Data Structures (4 problems)

**June 13th worth 7:15-8:15
* Finished up FCC Basic Data Structures
* Started Intro to Algorithms, get to skip ahead to "Finders Keepers"

### Day 30: June 14th, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Course on Injection attacks (treehouse)
* FCC JavaScript algorithms and data structures
  * completed: Basic JS, ES6, Regular Expressions, Debugging
  * started Basic Data Structures
* Chrome is now blocking github for who knows what reasons. I troubleshot that for about an hour without luck. Good times.  
  
**Thoughts**: Yup, made it to the other side of that bug. Hopping my way back into the saddle at FCC. Pretty disappointed that I haven't finished up the Responsive section, but the simple chunks of JS were easier for my brain to work on in its addled state. I'm still pretty beat. Tomorrow I'm going to do the Product Page assignment (finally got a good idea for it) and get back to React. Also, Brian and I got our boating licenses and officially bought tickets to Mexico today: Holy smokes!

### Day 29: June 11th, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Poking away at FCC. Very frustrated with the number of problems that are completely broken. This has been in beta for over a year, how are so problems many non-functioning? And it's simple things- typos in the source code. Wrong instructions. Wrong tests. Can't use the test or submit buttons. As much as I appreciate Quincy's work, I would have much preferred smaller updates that actually worked instead of this giant trash pile of maybe-it-passes-maybe-the-instructions-or-tests-are-all-wrong frustration-builder. And now I'm getting reminders to donate every few problems- I would have been much more willing to donate back when things worked!
* OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities (TeamTreehouse)

* Listened to JS party (about node) and finally watched WWDC '18. Lots of interesting things to play with but nothing truly revolutionary.
  
**Thoughts**: I am so sick (got much worse). All I could do is listen to podcasts and watch WWDC the past two days. This is the worst. I just need to get through to the other side.

### Day 28: June 9th, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Completed the basic survey form framework. Still needs styling and it can't be submitted, but it passes all the FCC test suite.
  * Today is Saturday. My goal is going to be to get the rest of the front end projects done (passing basic criteria) by Wednesday. I can always dress them up later. "Make it work. Make it good. Make it fast", right?
  * I really should move all these codepens to github as well
* Finished Regular Expressions in FCC javascript track  
* Listened to Tim Ferris Podcast: one-man million-dollar businesses. Inspiring hustles!
  
**Thoughts**: I took a few days off because 1) my dear cat was very sick and required frequent supervision to stay alive 2) I then got myself a respiratory infection myself so most of yesterday was sleeping and staring unfocusedly at the wall. Netflix and a little reading was the best my brain could do. Tony Bourdain died which was a shock. He is a big hero of my husband and mine and has deeply inspired how we travel and how we see the world. Thank you for everything, Tony, we will miss you so. 

Travel is one of the biggest reasons I've turned to code. Not only does it offer a more consistent (and higher) cash flow than I've had, but the idea of being a remote developer and being able to travel often is a huge appeal to me. I love my home but really want to explore the world, hopefully with my family. The option of spending a month here or there, or even a few weeks when I feel like it is a big draw. I'm focusing my track to that goal as much as I can. I've started reading more blogs and watching youtube videos to see how other traveling devs do it. Hard to stay focused when there's an ocean of options and reading materials and tutorials to do and I'm curious about everything!

### Day 27: June 6th, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Listening to CodeNewbie Podcast
* Working on the FCC Survey project
* Touched on Grasshopper app. I'm still not convinced it's good, despite all the recommendations.
  
**Thoughts**: I'm feeling a little tired and burned out. Even though this is day 28 of this 100 days, I've been working on code as much as possible for about three months now. I may slow my pace the next few days, I'm not sure. Feeling burned out is definitely something to take seriously. I find learning and coding fun and when I don't, it means I need to take a a little break and change tactics.

### Day 26: June 5th, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Going through FCC's JavaScript ES6 section, making notes on errors to report (there are many...)
* Working some on FCC Survey project
  
**Thoughts**: I haven't done a pull request on someone else's project so reporting FCC errors is a good idea for me. I am not feeling at my most code-creative this morning, but I'm taking useful notes. I'm surprised I'm not more motivated to finish the responsive section of FCC but I haven't had much sleep this week and that makes open-ended problems tougher. Boating class tonight. If all goes well, I should have my certificate this time next week so I can legally drive motorboats here in CT.

### Day 25: June 4th, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Watching a few enterpriseJS videos (spacesuits and node.js, very cool)
* Read up on news (oh boy, github acquisition by MS :/ ) Signed up for GitLabs to explore.
* Finished up FCC grid section. On to the new projects to finish up the Responsive Web Design Cert section!
* Listened to FCC podcast on transitioning from a non-CS field. Another gem, such a good show.
* Started FCC Survey Form project
* Finished the FCC basic JavaScript section update, started ES6 section
  
**Thoughts**: Whew, got in last night at 5am so a very slow start today. I'm going to get a few hours in before a birthday dinner with friends tonight. Ok, three hours done, time for a nap before we go out. I really hope MS doesn't do to Git what it did to Skype and LinkedIn.

### (Day 25: June 3rd, 2018, Sunday)
**Thoughts**: Taking the day off for my birthday in Bar Harbor/Acadia National Park!


### Day 24: June 2nd, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Sneaking my way through FreeCodeCamp exercises on my phone in the car (extremely poor mobile experience). Today barely counts, but some days I do 6-10 hours of coding and lessons so...
  * Completed CSS flexbox section, nearly all of CSS grid section
  
* Great job-ready conversation with a newer developer friend about his journey in Portland. "Learn basic javascript, convince someone to hire you as a junior dev and you're pretty much set for life. Get your head around Angular and demonstrate it well and you'll be like four steps ahead everyone else." Sounds about right. The more conversations I have with developers, the more confident I feel that I'm on the right track and moving to a good field.

**Thoughts**: Off to Portland and then Acadia for my birthday! Unfortunately, coding in the car makes me seriously naseous (as I found out immediately) and we had over seven hours of driving today. On the bright side, I'm coding on a beautiful sea-facing balcony tonight. Birthday luck kicked in in the form of an uncleaned room, so we were upgraded to a very nice one indeed. I wish I could spend a day working here (yes please) but we don't have the time. I love parking myself in a cafe or library or hotel nook and working somewhere new, letting the people watching and local food spark my problem solving creativity. Can't wait to explore tomorrow- lots of lupins out and I'm sure the hiking will be great. We'll see if I have meaningful time to code. It is officially my birthday now, after all. The incredible progress I've made on development is part of what makes this birthday feel like a real success.  
  
Here's to the next one- may it be even better!

### Day 23: June 1st, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Rocking my way through the new FreeCodeCamp- Wow, such huge changes!  
  * (re)completed basic html/html 5, basic css, applied visual design, applied accessibility, and responsive web design principles.

**Thoughts**: Working 9-5 today. Haven't touched 30 days 30 sites yet. I picked a poor week to start, but that doesn't matter. I'll do them later- I've been lucky to code at all. This is my birthday weekend!

**Links to work:**
1. [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/portfolio/chauxvive)


### Day 22: May 31, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Reviewing a little python today in prep for the python meetup tonight. Python was one of my first languages but it's been a while now. When I first started coding, I played with Project Euler and HackThisSite.
* Python Basics (treehouse)
* FIELD TRIP: Python meetup in New Haven.
* Checking out the new FreeCodeCamp- wow, those are serious changes. We'll see what I think of them. I definitely agree with some of the adds, as I had felt pretty overwhelmed when the first projects came up when I started.
* Happily filling in new bits of FCC to catch back up. Lots of great new material.

**Thoughts**: Working 9-5:30 today, meetup tonight at 6. I'm so bushed- I feel like I've been underslept and with a migraine off and on for days. Plus, migraines make it hard to look at a screen or think straight. Python has so many fun things - Django, PyCharms, Jypiter. I am starting to remember why I liked it so much when I was starting out. It was a good first language to play with. Some of this was over my head, but some of it was great. I definitely remember more than I thought I did. 

Already found bugs in the new FCC- several "lessons" can't be completed, meaning full sections can't be closed. As someone who lives to check things off lists, this drives me nuts.

### Day 21: May 30, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* 30 Days 30 sites
 * tempted to cheat and post the portfolio I made for FreeCodeCamp. I will post that- then I'll make a second different site later if I have the time. I definitely need to put them all on Git so I have a better streak.
* Back to React Basics on Treehouse. I plan on learning Angular, Express, and React but also eventually want to touch on others like Ember, Apollo, Meteor, etc.


**Thoughts**: Working 9-5:30 today, concert 7-10. Time is really flying by. I can't believe I'm already on day 22 (started at 0) of 100 of my reboot.


**Links to work:**

### Day 20: May 29, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Started work on React Basics (Treehouse)
  * Installed React dev tools, learned about properties
* Completed official React tutorial (tic-tac-toe game)  
* Completed section on application security (treehouse)
* Played with shiny new vscode extensions
* Signed up for 30 days 30 sites prompts and joined community. Looks promising. Hopefully this will give me the front-end bump I need.
* Had a quick phone chat about the costume site. If that project gets signed off with the new ownership, it's going to mean an enormous check. There's so much I could do to update the site with the best practices I know now (I built it 4 years ago and was learning as I went.) It would be awesome if I could convince them to have me do Social Media as well. It is SUCH a cool project but I've done far too much unpaid work on the project as it is. No more until the contract is approved! Reading Elon Musk biography.

**Thoughts**: Working 9-6 today. Coding on breaks and after work. Surprise! Working 9-5:30 the rest of the week. On the down side, that means I can't take the boating license course this week. On the up side, more money for our upcoming Tulum trip and that means I can go to code meetups in the evening instead. Honestly, one of the things I'm most looking forward to with Tulum is checking out the digital nomad community there and seeing what that life is like. Definitely my dream to be able to code and travel!

### Day 19: May 28, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* _COMPLETED THE FULL-STACK JAVASCRIPT TRACK ON TREEHOUSE_. whoa.
* Completed unit testing in Mocha and Chai
   * learned about mocha --watch and mocha reporting options.
   * learned about stubs and mocks
   * learned about cross origin resource sharing
* Videos on React and Vue
* Intro to Application Security (treehouse)
* Learned the hard reminder to commit often- lost three days of notes because I had forgotten to git commit this log. Bummer!
* 235 Twitter followers. Social Media is pretty simple when you get the hang of it. If I want more, I know what to do. I put my Instagram account down when I started coding full-time and I've only lost around a hundred followers of my 1200, even though I've posted nothing since February. I look forward to picking that up again some day when I'm not as code-driven.

**Thoughts**: Fighting with internet and windows updates makes getting through exercises slow and painful. Will have to get up early tomorrow to code before work since I just found out I'm going in. Saw "Solo". Finally completed the full-stack track, although I have to come back and fix a few projects in there to really finish up properly.

### Day 18: May 27, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* More testing in Mocha and Chai
* Read Vue and Chai documentation

**Thoughts**: Coded on the train on the way to NYC to see a my friend's show. 260 performances on Broadway.

### Day 17: May 26, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Building and testing a battleship game engine with BDD and testing it with Mocha and Chai (treehouse)
* Decided I should pick up my Twitter game. Looking to get to >200 from ~150.

**Thoughts**: Starting the day coding outside in the hammock- truly a great day. Sailing with Jenn.

### Day 16: May 25, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Understanding Promises in JavaScript (Treehouse)
* Answered my first question in the Treehouse forums. I want to give back to the community and show my competance by doing more of this both on Treehouse and StackOverflow. Plus, I'll practice troubleshooting other people's code and check my own understanding.
   
**Thoughts**: I finally got dad home yesterday! Today is a truly beautiful day so I will not be coding as long as usual.

### Day 15: May 24, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Debugging REST API routes
* Completed 1/4 blocks of JavaScript Testing (Treehouse) learning about Mocha and BDD
* FIELD TRIP: Coding hang out at Checkmate Digital
   
**Thoughts**: SO HAPPY this last course in my track is Gil. Also excited about learning testing which is going to fill in a lot of gaps. After I complete this, I'll go back and wrap up the few projects I didn't fully debug. Surprise surprise, three Chalkley projects: Command Line Weather, Flashcards project, and the Rest API project which has errors in the routes I have to figure out. I got up early to do a bit before hitting the gym and picking up dad at the hospital. I am also supposed to go to Checkmate today to "hang out and see the office," so hopefully I can get dad home sooner rather than later and get down New Haven!

### Day 14: May 23, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Troubleshooting REST API routes on Treehouse. Still in progress.
* FIELD TRIP XCite women in entrepreneurship, tech, and innovation conference today in Stamford
* Brushing up on my javascript history and know-how with Treehouse "The Landscape of JavaScript"
* Starting "Beginning React" in Treehouse
* Reading up on linters, "Prettier", Mocha, and GraphQL
* Short brainstorming session with graphic designer friend about working together
   
**Thoughts**: I went to the XCite women in Entrepreneurship, Technology, and Innovation convention in Stamford today. Unfortunately, of course, then they said dad could go home... Except that in trying to arrange a ride for him (and explaining that I couldn't get there before 3:00) his anxiety amped his blood pressure so high that when I got there they couldn't release him after all (222! jesus.) I promised I would be there first thing tomorrow and we'd watch Netflix until he's released. The conference was ok- not as code helpful as I would have hoped, but I still found more local resources and talking to someone from the CT small business association got my brain going about doing more social media and SEO consulting. It would really be great it I could start making cash so I could have the option of a bootcamp to do this a bit faster/more efficiently. This "Landscape of JavaScript" course is really cool!

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued building a REST API on treehouse
   
**Thoughts**: Slow, wet, grim day today. Dad is still stuck at the hospital. They need to make sure they have the dosage of his antibiotics right so it won't overtax his kidneys. I'm not sure how I'm going to get him home tomorrow- the XCite women's tech conference is in Stamford and I was going to go. 

I've figured out exactly why I dislike Chalkley classes- he'll do like a 20 minute video with all kinds of different adds and no testing until the very end. This means if any facet doesn't work, you have serious digging to do. For example, I just realized over half my Postman routes aren't working and I'm definitely going to go take a coffee break before I throw something.

### Day 12: May 21, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued building a REST API on treehouse
   * used Postman to test GET and POST requests.
   * practiced creating database queries in Mongoose
   * completed 4/5 sections on this project
 * Listened to more podcasts and read more articles on getting a first dev job

**Thoughts**: Dad isn't coming home today after all- some kind of bacteria they found in his foot. Working on code before I go visit him- he's so disappointed. I'm glad to be using Git consistently but I know there are ways I'm doing things inefficiently. I'll get there eventually. I also notice that several months of coding every free second is taking its toll on my body. I've got to balance learning as hard and fast as I can with the rest of my life, ha, things like working out, spending time in the sun, staying married, cooking and eating good food and -gulp- laundry. Every once and a while, I need to sit and read something irrelevant or watch netflix, because being burned out will not actually help this process.

### Day 11: May 20, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse)!
  * using template logic to display certain pages to users and change nav bar if user is logged in
  * using custom middleware to determine and restrict authorized areas of the site
* Started REST API building course (Treehouse)
* Researched wireframing tools, job descriptions, and bootcamps

**Thoughts**: Got home from work last night (2:30am) with a bad fever. Taking it very easy today and trying to sleep as much as possible. Dad can go home from the hospital tomorrow at 10. I'm so close to the end of the full-stack track on Treehouse! 
Update: REST is another Chalkley course. He is by far my least favorite treehouse teacher. His material is great but I'm always getting lost!

### Day 10: May 19, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Still working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse)
  * using express-session to store and track logins
  * creating a login form and route with error catching
  * fixed bugs
  * One more set of videos in this project to go!
* Spent more time brainstorming apps. Up to 54/100 ideas, many of which I'm excited about. Many of these are apps I really could use, and several are so specialized I'm sure they don't exist. Working on these will give me the practice and portfolio of independent projects I need.  

**Thoughts**: I love that I understand so much of this now. The components I'm learning to build will be helpful in so many projects. Brian was playing "Shooglenifty" this grey morning and I am missing Ireland big-time.

### Day 9: May 18, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Brainstorming apps all the time now
* Spent some time journaling and planning about next steps- meeting Tuesday with a graphic designer friend and and business consultant friend on Tuesday to see if we can come up with a package to offer the game shop. Pretty excited about this idea. This could be a very powerful value-add. 
* Followed up on the offer of "hanging out" at Checkmate (a development agency) next week, asked a JS mentor for book recommendations, listened to code podcasts, and thought about how I might offer photography for the bare walls of the coworking space. Considering volunteering with the "Real Food" project. 

**Thoughts**: Today I was up at 7:30 to visit dad before his operation, waited with him (as the doctors and chaplin came in, ugh,) and then occupied myself with "TrollHunter" episodes until he was out of recovery. I was a nervous wreck until he came back at 3:30, honestly, couldn't do anything else. Ever since he was diagnosed with the cancer, I've been hyper aware that I very well may lose him soon. Some days it's ok and some days it's harder. After I got him settled (about 4) I could relax enough to get myself some food, and after another visit, went home to have wine and celebrate him surviving another day.   

I'm not ashamed that I didn't code, but I am happy that I still pushed my "code journey". Even more important than pushing yourself on projects and languages is assessing where you want to be and how to get there. You can run as hard as you want, but you still need to be sure of your direction. Listening to leadership podcasts and reading these folks (Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, "Goal Diggers", "World Wanderers") has changed my life so much over the past five years or so. I'm working through "The Magic of Thinking Big" and "You Don't Know JS" right now as well, which I both recommend.

### Day 8: May 17, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Still working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse) 
* Great JavaScript-focused meetup with NewHavenIO - so excited that one talk focused on stuff I wouldn't have understood at all last week and could completely follow today (using websockets to make a SlackBot.) 

**Thoughts**: Much shorter day today- Worked until about 2 last night, then had to leave at 7 to take dad to the hospital for his operation tomorrow, then was at the hospital until 3. Face-planted into a nap until the meetup, and then boardgame meetup (I played a round then returned to my coding.) I felt really dispirited yesterday, but again, seeing the problems from all kinds of new angles today. I started brainstorming app ideas - my goal is to come up with 100 in a day or two (currently at 14). Idea-storming is a good practice: the sheer volume means you shut up your inner critique enough to come up with more creative ideas (skimmed from James Altucher.)

### Day 7: May 16, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse) 
  * made a registration page in pug and routed with Express, set up nodemon for server refreshing
  * started with Mongoose, created routes to a from registration into mongo
  * used bcrypt to salt and hash passwords before saving to db (kinda important. just a bit.)

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired and a little burned out today. I'm really crunching to get through the full-stack track on Treehouse, for better and worse. Afterwards, I'm not sure if I'm going to go through WordPress on treehouse to make faster freelancing money or go back to FreeCodeCamp or what. On the other hand, the stuff we're making in Treehouse is really cool.

### Day 6: May 15, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* ACTUALLY installed mongodb, since I realized I had not really done so last time
* Read up on windows permissions (no sudo for me, I see. And no mongo-hacker either!)
* Got through over half of the treehouse mongo course. +1 for "poutine authentic chillwave"- I think these demo blog posts were just deep sourced from Portlandia episodes.
* MADE IT. MADE IT THROUGH THE MONGODB COURSE. Hot diggity. 

**Thoughts**: Definitely fighting with Windows this morning! Looking forward to more databases. Is that weird? That seems weird.

### Day 5: May 14, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
 * Continued work on Flashcards app:
   * error-corrected /cards route 
   * worked with modular parameters
   * fleshed out the question/answer sides
   * made random path through card data
   * learned how to serve static assets in Express
  * Installed and started using MongoDB   

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the Express course! Still need to finish cleaning up the app for the last step, but glad I got through all the videos. First thing this morning, I really fought on error-checking "unidentified" problems with my /cards route. Turned out it was a hard-to-spot spacing error on the pug file! Definitely going to keep in mind that's an easy error to make with pug. Not sure I'm sold on pug's "easy" syntax yet, although templating is something I have used before with the costume website project. That made updates considerably easier years later, though I didn't know much at the time. This stuff is complicated and with many interconnected parts- chasing errors is taking a LOT more time than I am used to. I also think the last video sailed through an awful lot in a brief time. Chalkley courses tend to do that, but overall this course was much easier to follow than his others.

### Day 4: May 13, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued work on Flashcards app. Sent/read my first username cookies, did route handling, error handling, and played with lots of middleware with Express. Can't wait to start working with databases.
* Read up on closures

**Thoughts**: Excited to start sending cookies and reading states. Unlike my early interactions with node and JSON, I can say I really get this stuff the first time around and find myself in a state of flow where hours fly by unnoticed. I am eager to finish the Treehouse Full Stack track. So close at this point!

### Day 3: May 12, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* More CodeAcademy on JavaScript. I don't remember the old course being this buggy!
* Finished Gulp on Treehouse, started Treehouse Express flashcard app with Pug template. Really sailing through here.
* Sent out three bids to small Upwork projects. 
* Read up on CRLF/LF endings, "use strict" in JS, and marketing for new devs.

**Thoughts**: Definitely seeing better why Gulp is important today. I can't wait to start building apps and using this stuff. Also excited to get into Express, MongoDB, Angular, React, and Redux. I'm really looking forward to building this flashcard app and customizing it later on. At some point, I need to learn Sass, Canvas, and grid/flexbox/bootstrap better.

### Day 2: May 11, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Did the gulp tutorial on TeamTreehouse. Successfully installed windows build tools with powershell.
* Read about powershell vs cmd and the history of each.
* Read about React, JSX, and Redux
* Ripped out some easy JavaScript and Ruby exercises back at CodeAcademy

**Thoughts**: Gulp is simple to understand and cool for automating tasks, but I think I need more practice without it to really appreciate what its used for. Hard to believe I was completely unfamiliar with using command line and npm a few weeks ago- now it's the linchpin of most of my work. Had to bring my stepmom home from the hospital and deal with dad today- more than had my hands full. It reminds me why I'm doing this: with dad's cancer, I need to be free when I have to be but still make money. That's why I'm studying as hard and as fast as I can.  
However, I need to keep my eye on the prize- being a in-depth full stack dev is less important than bringing in money which may mean monetizing simpler front-end things. It means taking the good over the perfect- which means reviewing and practicing WordPress and front end so I can do that quickly and easily (because those gigs are more accessible to new developers.) Tweaking WordPress themes quickly and easily will probably make more money now than having a medium familiarity with creating APIs from scratch.

### Day 1: May 10, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Updated theater portfolio website with L'Egisto section 
* Did Codewars 7kyu kata
* Improved CS50 Mario to "more" version
* Wrote and debugged CS50 Cash, started Credit 
* Reviewed Markdown conventions and shortcuts
* Read up on floating point arithmetic and rounding errors. Gross.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get back to JavaScript after fooling with Ruby, C#, and C the past few days. Really glad I understand Markdown now. Between that and getting used to Git and terminal, I'm starting to feel more like a "real" developer. Every time I force myself to go to code meetups, I enjoy myself and learn a lot, even if it's outside of my comfort zone. Yesterday I felt very "stuck" on the material I had been learning the past few weeks (AHH why is going from front end JS to back end so hard??) but I sat down and figured out exactly why I felt so stuck, then jotted down actionable goals of what progress would look like and how I could get there. Now I feel like I've had a minor breakthrough. It's amazing how facing your frustrations and fears head-on can help you move past them.

### Day 0: May 9, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on Harvard's CS50. Today was fighting through the first few of problem set one (Hello, Mario). Updated my wordpress theater portfolio with new features. 

**Thoughts**: Restarting #100daysofcode so I can track it here. My original attempt was at around 27 days. It's been a very chaotic season with family health and too many funerals but I'm not giving up. I've been using FreeCodeCamp, TeamTreehouse, CodeAcademy, and CodeWars. I've also started going to the New Haven I/O meetups and joined their slack which has been very helpful.   

C is so far my absolute least favorite language (of Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift etc.) Hate. Such hate. But it's like Latin, right, I'm not really supposed to like it? Or maybe more like classical greek which I enjoyed even less?
