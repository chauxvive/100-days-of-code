# 100 Days Of Code - Log


#

### Day 12: May 21, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued building a REST API on treehouse
   * used Postman to test GET and POST requests.
   * practiced creating database queries in Mongoose
   * completed 3/5 sections on this project
 * Listened to more podcasts and read more articles on getting a first dev job

**Thoughts**: Dad isn't coming home today after all- some kind of bacteria they found in his foot. Working on code before I go visit him- he's so disappointed. I'm glad to be using Git consistently but I know there are ways I'm doing things inefficiently. I'll get there eventually. I also notice that several months of coding every free second is taking its toll on my body. I've got to balance learning as hard and fast as I can with the rest of my life, ha, things like working out, spending time in the sun, staying married, cooking and eating good food and -gulp- laundry. Every once and a while, I need to sit and read something irrelevant or watch netflix, because being burned out will not actually help this process.

### Day 11: May 20, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse)!
  * using template logic to display certain pages to users and change nav bar if user is logged in
  * using custom middleware to determine and restrict authorized areas of the site
* Started REST API building course (Treehouse)
* Researched wireframing tools, job descriptions, and bootcamps

**Thoughts**: Got home from work last night (2:30am) with a bad fever. Taking it very easy today and trying to sleep as much as possible. Dad can go home from the hospital tomorrow at 10. I'm so close to the end of the full-stack track on Treehouse! 
Update: REST is another Chalkley course. He is by far my least favorite treehouse teacher. His material is great but I'm always getting lost!

### Day 10: May 19, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Still working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse)
  * using express-session to store and track logins
  * creating a login form and route with error catching
  * fixed bugs
  * One more set of videos in this project to go!
* Spent more time brainstorming apps. Up to 54/100 ideas, many of which I'm excited about. Many of these are apps I really could use, and several are so specialized I'm sure they don't exist. Working on these will give me the practice and portfolio of independent projects I need.  

**Thoughts**: I love that I understand so much of this now. The components I'm learning to build will be helpful in so many projects. Brian was playing "Shooglenifty" this grey morning and I am missing Ireland bigtime.

### Day 9: May 18, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Brainstorming apps all the time now
* Spent some time journaling and planning about next steps- meeting Tuesday with a graphic designer friend and and business consultant friend on Tuesday to see if we can come up with a package to offer the game shop. Pretty excited about this idea. This could be a very powerful value-add. 
* Followed up on the offer of "hanging out" at Checkmate (a development agency) next week, asked a JS mentor for book recommendations, listened to code podcasts, and thought about how I might offer photography for the bare walls of the coworking space. Considering volunteering with the "Real Food" project. 

**Thoughts**: Today I was up at 7:30 to visit dad before his operation, waited with him (as the doctors and chaplin came in, ugh,) and then occupied myself with "TrollHunter" episodes until he was out of recovery. I was a nervous wreck until he came back at 3:30, honestly, couldn't do anything else. Ever since he was diagnosed with the cancer, I've been hyper aware that I very well may lose him soon. Some days it's ok and some days it's harder. After I got him settled (about 4) I could relax enough to get myself some food, and after another visit, went home to have wine and celebrate him surviving another day.   

I'm not ashamed that I didn't code, but I am happy that I still pushed my "code journey". Even more important than pushing yourself on projects and languages is assessing where you want to be and how to get there. You can run as hard as you want, but you still need to be sure of your direction. Listening to leadership podcasts and reading these folks (Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, "Goal Diggers", "World Wanderers") has changed my life so much over the past five years or so. I'm working through "The Magic of Thinking Big" and "You Don't Know JS" right now as well, which I both recommend.

### Day 8: May 17, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Still working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse) 
* Great JavaScript-focused meetup with NewHavenIO - so excited that one talk focused on stuff I wouldn't have understood at all last week and could completely follow today (using websockets to make a SlackBot.) 

**Thoughts**: Much shorter day today- Worked until about 2 last night, then had to leave at 7 to take dad to the hospital for his operation tomorrow, then was at the hospital until 3. Face-planted into a nap until the meetup, and then boardgame meetup (I played a round then returned to my coding.) I felt really dispirited yesterday, but again, seeing the problems from all kinds of new angles today. I started brainstorming app ideas - my goal is to come up with 100 in a day or two (currently at 14). Idea-storming is a good practice: the sheer volume means you shut up your inner critique enough to come up with more creative ideas (skimmed from James Altucher.)

### Day 7: May 16, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Working through the JS authentication and authorization with Mongo and Express (Treehouse) 
  * made a registration page in pug and routed with Express, set up nodemon for server refreshing
  * started with Mongoose, created routes to a from registration into mongo
  * used bcrypt to salt and hash passwords before saving to db (kinda important. just a bit.)

**Thoughts**: Feeling tired and a little burned out today. I'm really crunching to get through the full-stack track on Treehouse, for better and worse. Afterwards, I'm not sure if I'm going to go through WordPress on treehouse to make faster freelancing money or go back to FreeCodeCamp or what. On the other hand, the stuff we're making in Treehouse is really cool.

### Day 6: May 15, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
* ACTUALLY installed mongodb, since I realized I had not really done so last time
* Read up on windows permissions (no sudo for me, I see. And no mongo-hacker either!)
* Got through over half of the treehouse mongo course. +1 for "poutine authentic chillwave"- I think these demo blog posts were just deep sourced from Portlandia episodes.
* MADE IT. MADE IT THROUGH THE MONGODB COURSE. Hot diggity. 

**Thoughts**: Definitely fighting with Windows this morning! Looking forward to more databases. Is that weird? That seems weird.

### Day 5: May 14, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
 * Continued work on Flashcards app:
   * error-corrected /cards route 
   * worked with modular parameters
   * fleshed out the question/answer sides
   * made random path through card data
   * learned how to serve static assets in Express
  * Installed and started using MongoDB   

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the Express course! Still need to finish cleaning up the app for the last step, but glad I got through all the videos. First thing this morning, I really fought on error-checking "unidentified" problems with my /cards route. Turned out it was a hard-to-spot spacing error on the pug file! Definitely going to keep in mind that's an easy error to make with pug. Not sure I'm sold on pug's "easy" syntax yet, although templating is something I have used before with the costume website project. That made updates considerably easier years later, though I didn't know much at the time. This stuff is complicated and with many interconnected parts- chasing errors is taking a LOT more time than I am used to. I also think the last video sailed through an awful lot in a brief time. Chalkley courses tend to do that, but overall this course was much easier to follow than his others.

### Day 4: May 13, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Continued work on Flashcards app. Sent/read my first username cookies, did route handling, error handling, and played with lots of middleware with Express. Can't wait to start working with databases.
* Read up on closures

**Thoughts**: Excited to start sending cookies and reading states. Unlike my early interactions with node and JSON, I can say I really get this stuff the first time around and find myself in a state of flow where hours fly by unnoticed. I am eager to finish the Treehouse Full Stack track. So close at this point!

### Day 3: May 12, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* More CodeAcademy on JavaScript. I don't remember the old course being this buggy!
* Finished Gulp on Treehouse, started Treehouse Express flashcard app with Pug template. Really sailing through here.
* Sent out three bids to small Upwork projects. 
* Read up on CRLF/LF endings, "use strict" in JS, and marketing for new devs.

**Thoughts**: Definitely seeing better why Gulp is important today. I can't wait to start building apps and using this stuff. Also excited to get into Express, MongoDB, Angular, React, and Redux. I'm really looking forward to building this flashcard app and customizing it later on. At some point, I need to learn Sass, Canvas, and grid/flexbox/bootstrap better.

### Day 2: May 11, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Did the gulp tutorial on TeamTreehouse. Successfully installed windows build tools with powershell.
* Read about powershell vs cmd and the history of each.
* Read about React, JSX, and Redux
* Ripped out some easy JavaScript and Ruby exercises back at CodeAcademy

**Thoughts**: Gulp is simple to understand and cool for automating tasks, but I think I need more practice without it to really appreciate what its used for. Hard to believe I was completely unfamiliar with using command line and npm a few weeks ago- now it's the linchpin of most of my work. Had to bring my stepmom home from the hospital and deal with dad today- more than had my hands full. It reminds me why I'm doing this: with dad's cancer, I need to be free when I have to be but still make money. That's why I'm studying as hard and as fast as I can.  
However, I need to keep my eye on the prize- being a in-depth full stack dev is less important than bringing in money which may mean monetizing simpler front-end things. It means taking the good over the perfect- which means reviewing and practicing WordPress and front end so I can do that quickly and easily (because those gigs are more accessible to new developers.) Tweaking WordPress themes quickly and easily will probably make more money now than having a medium familiarity with creating APIs from scratch.

### Day 1: May 10, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Updated theater portfolio website with L'Egisto section 
* Did Codewars 7kyu kata
* Improved CS50 Mario to "more" version
* Wrote and debugged CS50 Cash, started Credit 
* Reviewed Markdown conventions and shortcuts
* Read up on floating point arithmetic and rounding errors. Gross.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to get back to JavaScript after fooling with Ruby, C#, and C the past few days. Really glad I understand Markdown now. Between that and getting used to Git and terminal, I'm starting to feel more like a "real" developer. Every time I force myself to go to code meetups, I enjoy myself and learn a lot, even if it's outside of my comfort zone. Yesterday I felt very "stuck" on the material I had been learning the past few weeks (AHH why is going from front end JS to back end so hard??) but I sat down and figured out exactly why I felt so stuck, then jotted down actionable goals of what progress would look like and how I could get there. Now I feel like I've had a minor breakthrough. It's amazing how facing your frustrations and fears head-on can help you move past them.

### Day 0: May 9, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on Harvard's CS50. Today was fighting through the first few of problem set one (Hello, Mario). Updated my wordpress theater portfolio with new features. 

**Thoughts**: Restarting #100daysofcode so I can track it here. My original attempt was at around 27 days. It's been a very chaotic season with family health and too many funerals but I'm not giving up. I've been using FreeCodeCamp, TeamTreehouse, CodeAcademy, and CodeWars. I've also started going to the New Haven I/O meetups and joined their slack which has been very helpful.   

C is so far my absolute least favorite language (of Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Swift etc.) Hate. Such hate. But it's like Latin, right, I'm not really supposed to like it? Or maybe more like classical greek which I enjoyed even less?
